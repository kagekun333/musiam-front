Fifty-four: Misfortune

Body and mind in disagreement  
Just being anxious cannot distinguish between good and bad.  
Eclipse darkens the vast sky  
Like an eclipse, gradually dark clouds gather, enveloping everything in darkness.  
Though the wheel is always in hand  
Even with a vehicle, if the destination is undecided, good things in front cannot be attained.  
Fish and water have yet to meet  
Like a fish that will die without encountering water, if one cannot connect with those around them, nothing can be accomplished. It is important to often adapt to this world and maintain a calm demeanor.

Illness: Dangerous.  
Lost items: Hard to recover.  
The person hoped for: Will not appear.
