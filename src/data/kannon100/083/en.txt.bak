Eighty-Three: Misfortune

Stepping out of the clouds  
I wish to lift my foot and ride the clouds to ascend to the heavens, but I cannot reach the sky. High aspirations are futile.  
Branches hard to climb  
I want to climb the high branches, but the branches I can grasp seem no higher than this; my life is unstable, and there is no support.  
Looking up at the bright moon  
I look up at the sky, even if I wish to see the clear moon,  
Still hidden among dark clouds  
The moon I long to see remains concealed in the clouds, unable to be properly viewed. I should quietly correct my behavior.  

Wishes: Hard to realize.  
Illness: Will linger.  
Lost items: Hard to find.  
The person I long for: Will not appear.  
Building a new home, moving: Will be bad.  
Travel: Will be dangerous.  
Marriage, relationships: Will lead to bad outcomes.
