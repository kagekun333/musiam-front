Fifth: Misfortune

The family fortune cannot prosper.  
Even if one tries hard with the family business, it is difficult to thrive compared to the effort put in.  
Danger brings calamity.  
Itâ€™s not a life filled with disasters, but rather that there are more dangerous situations.  
Dark clouds obscure the laurel.  
Like dark clouds covering the moon, there are more obstacles in life.  
A noble lady and a stick of incense.  
In the room of a woman of high status, various thoughts spread like incense, leaving the heart unsettled.  

Wishes: Difficult to fulfill.  
Illness: Hard to cure.  
Lost items: Hard to find.  
The person hoped for: Will not appear.  
Building a new home or moving: Better to give up for now and observe the situation.  
Marriage, travel, and socializing: Due to the overall misfortune, please act with caution in all matters.
