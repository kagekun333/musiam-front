Fourteenth - Minor Good Fortune  
When jade and stone are not yet distinguished  
Just like when there are precious gems, it is still unclear which is the gem and which is the stone, making it impossible to discern the situation of things.  
Worries turn to deeper sorrow  
Even if one wishes to stand out, one may still feel heartache, sigh, and sadness due to various matters.  
The future leads to a broad path  
If one endures hardships, the future will naturally reveal its direction.  
Flowers bloom on withered branches  
Then, like flowers blooming on dry branches, wishes will be fulfilled.  
Wish:  
It takes a long time but will be realized.  
Illness:  
It may be prolonged, but it will not threaten life.  
Lost items:  
They are unlikely to appear.  
Hoped-for person:  
They seem to become delayed.  
Building a new home, moving:  
Not very good.  
Marriage:  
One should exercise restraint now; it will be good in the future.  
Travel, socializing:  
Avoid it.
