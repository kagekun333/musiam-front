Sixty-Five: Minor Good Fortune  
Suffering from illness and preventing humiliation  
Feeling the inner pain and being insulted, it is unstable.  
Facing danger yet not escaping  
Just like a person facing danger who has not yet awakened, this difficulty cannot be resolved so easily.  
If one sees the sun after  
If spring has arrived (if there is the compassionate brilliance of Avalokiteshvara), good things will also come.  
Only then can a good plan be made  
Once good things start to happen, please set a plan and take action. Until good things begin, please quietly endure.  
Desire:  
It will be realized in the future.  
Illness:  
Though prolonged, it will be cured.  
Lost items:  
They will not appear.  
Hoped-for person:  
They will appear later than expected.  
Building a new home, moving:  
It will be good.  
Travel:  
It will be safe.  
Marriage, dating:  
There will be a fairly good outcome.
