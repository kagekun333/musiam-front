**Twenty-Eight: Misfortune**

Swiftly, there is no boat to cross  
It seems that even if one is anxious in their heart, the boat does not move forward; it is merely a state of urgency, and nothing changes.  
Deep waves must lead to misfortune  
It feels as if, even when one tries to forcefully cross the ocean or river, the waves are high and dangerous; wanting to reach the destination quickly only results in tying a noose around one’s own neck.  
One must return to the old path  
Rather than striving to stand out in a foreign land, it is better to return to one’s hometown and live quietly.  
Only then can one avoid disaster  
If that is the case, one can escape from calamity, and one’s life will become stable.
