Thirty-Second: Good Fortune

Like jade hidden deep within stone  
Just as one might not realize that a gem is concealed beneath the rock, if one has talent but remains indifferent and does not strive to showcase it, nothing can be gained.  
Do not regard with old eyes  
If one looks at things without concern for the present, talent will be buried away like that.  
Once a good craftsman departs  
However, if one continues to work hard persistently, one may unknowingly be discovered by good teachers and helpful friends.  
Then the gem's brilliance is revealed  
And just like a polished gem shining brightly, one can showcase results and contribute to society.

Wishes: They will be fulfilled.  
Illness: It may be prolonged, but life will not be lost.  
Lost items: They will appear.  
Longed-for person: They may take a while to show up.  
Building a new home, moving: It will be fine.  
Marriage, relationships: All will be related to good outcomes.
