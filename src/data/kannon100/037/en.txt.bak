Thirty-Seven ã€€Half Good Fortune

The shadows linger, unable to clear.  
Like thick and long dark clouds, indistinguishable from east to west, my heart is confused; my wishes cannot yet reach the heavens.  
Seeking fame has not yet met with fortune.  
Though I pray for recognition in the world, it seems I have not yet encountered the opportunity.  
Fortunately, change must come.  
But the pain in my heart will fade, fortune will unfold, and happier days will surely arrive.  
Like hitting two birds with one arrow, good things seem to come one after another.  

Wishes: Difficult to realize.  
Illness: It will take time to improve.  
Lost items: They will take time to reappear.  
The person I long for: They will take time to show up.  
Building a new home, moving: Good.  
Travel: Good.  
Marriage, dating: A little later, it will be good.
