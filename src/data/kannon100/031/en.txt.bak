31st - Minor Good Fortune  
When the Kunpeng has not yet transformed  
Because the Kunpeng is a very large fish, it will unknowingly transform into a great bird. However, since it has not yet changed, it is still holding onto great hopes, but they cannot be realized at this moment.  
Guarding the Azure Stream  
Just like temporarily guarding the deep blue stream, waiting for the right moment to arrive, daily actions should be cautious, waiting for good fortune to come.  
Winds and Clouds Stirring Up Giant Waves  
By doing so, when the time comes, the transformation into a great bird will arrive. Stirring up the waves, there is a boiling heart that wishes to fly towards the sky. When good fortune arrives, striving towards success and continuously putting in effort is very important.  
A Breath Across the Horizon  
By doing this, one will soar into the sky in one breath. Walking the path to success, it seems that there will be a good reputation spreading far and wide in the world.
