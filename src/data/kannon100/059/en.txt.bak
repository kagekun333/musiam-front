Fifty-Ninth: Misfortune  
Unsettled Heart  
With a drifting and uncertain heart, there is no decision (no determination).  
Actions and Concealments are also Unsettled  
It is merely a confusion towards things, filled with various anxieties.  
A Clear and Bright Moon  
Although the bright moon in the heart shines clearly and brilliantly,  
It is Covered by Dark Clouds  
But it is overshadowed by the clouds of confusion, and not even a glimpse of the future can be seen. Hurry and remove the clouds of confusion, and reclaim the original heart.
